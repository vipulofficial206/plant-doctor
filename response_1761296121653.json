    "content": "Common Rust is a disease caused by a fungus (a type of tiny germ) that mainly affects corn, but can also be found on sorghum and some grasses.\n\n### What to Look For\n*   Small, oval, or cinnamon-brown powdery spots on both the upper and lower surfaces of the leaves.\n*   These spots, called pustules, will release a rusty-colored powder if you rub them. This powder contains spores (like tiny seeds) that spread the disease.\n*   Later in the season, the spots may turn dark brown or black.\n\n### Conditions That Favor the Disease\n*   Cool temperatures (60-80°F / 16-27°C).\n*   High humidity and moisture on the leaves from dew, fog, or light rain for several hours.\n\n### How to Manage Common Rust\n*   **Plant Resistant Hybrids:** This is the most effective and cheapest way to control it. Ask your seed dealer for corn varieties that have good resistance to Common Rust.\n*   **Apply Fungicides:** If the disease appears early on a susceptible hybrid and the weather is cool and wet, a fungicide (a spray that kills fungus) may be needed to protect your yield. Scout your fields regularly to catch it early.\n*   **Crop Rotation:** Planting a different crop, like soybeans, in the field next year can help reduce the amount of fungus that survives over winter.",
